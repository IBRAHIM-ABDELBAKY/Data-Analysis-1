# Data-Analysis-1
Overview
In this project, I make use of Python to exploring data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, I use:

Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
VS code.
VS code terminal.
